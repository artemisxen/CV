I am a London based Junior Full Stack Developer,
passionate about problem solving, learning new technologies and best coding practices. My curiosity and my passion on understanding how things work led me to study at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) where apart from learning coding, we focused on object oriented programming, agile techniques, pair programming, and test driven development.  

Through my civil engineering background I have developed excellent problem solving and analytical skills, and working in high demanding environment increased my ability to work under pressure and with attention to detail.  

I am excited about new challenges and responsibilities and I am looking for a role as a Junior Full Stack Developer.

## Skills

#### Analytical thinker
Working for over a decade as civil engineer enhanced my analytical skills and my ability of problem solving by breaking every problem into small parts and using logical steps to understand an issue from all angles before performing an action.

#### Working under pressure
As a member of a project management team in construction I had to deal with deadlines and working efficiently under pressure, even in more than one projects at the same time. From this experience I realised that I tend to thrive under pressure because it forces me to focus on what I’m doing, assess my priorities, and come up with a plan.

#### Attention to detail
In my previous job as civil engineer, where my responsibilities included checking financial reports and technical drawings for accuracy of calculations, it was important to pay attention to details, which turned to be a helpful skill during studying at Makers Academy for debugging and learning new technologies.

#### Teamwork
I have worked in teams of all sizes, either in my professional or educational life. Pair programming in daily basis and working in project groups is part of Makers Academy learning approach, which improved my ability to collaborate and communicate better within a team.
